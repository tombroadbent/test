to schedule the exit date for a missionary, the 6-week transfer cycle needs to be considered

a mission is 18m (female) or 2y (male)

a missionary gets a start date assigned

the missionary exit date is the closest transfer date to the completion date (18m or 2y) 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Assumption: Only consider the mission of the missionary
Assumption: Only consider “normal” completion (not getting release or mission reorganization) 
Context/detail: The start date is the beginning of MTC. MTC times vary on missions. 
Context/detail: Closest transfer data could be one before or one after.

Inputs:
Gender (str [m | f])
Start date str ISO 8601
Transfer date for that mission ISO 8601 
Validation:
Transfer date must be less than completion date -6 weeks 


Output:
Two closest transfer dates. One before and one after str ISO 8601 
Completion date str ISO 8601

algorithm:
Prompt the user for gender 
Prompt the user for start date 
Get the completion date.
Prompt the user for the transfer date.
Compute nearest transfer date of completion date 
Using transfer date, use a loop to add 6 weeks until we reach or pass one of completion date. 
Loop every 6 weeks 
If completion date is reached 
If first loop stops, get one more transfer after completion date. 
Variables to keep track of previous and current transfer 
Output transfer dates 

algorithm for while loop:
Start at t0 
Add 6 weeks to t0 to get t1
T0 in e0 and t1 in e1 
E0 is < c AND e1 >= c 

Pseudo Code:
Gender = str(input(“What is your gender? (M/F) “))
Duration = 0
If gender.lower() = “m”:
	Duration = 24
Elif gender.lower() = “f”
	Duration = 18
Start_date = str(input(“What is your start date? (YYYY-MM-DD)  “))
Completion_date = start_date + duration 
Transfer_date = str(input(“What is the next transfer date? (YYYY-MM-DD) “))
transferBeforeCompletion = transfer_date
transferAfterCompletion = transfer_date + 6 weeks
If t >= Completion_date:
	Print Must be less than completion date
Else:
	transferBeforeCompletion = transferAfterCompletion 
	transferAfterCompletion = transferBeforeCompletion + 6
while transferBeforeCompletion < Completion_date and transferAfterCompletion >= Completion_date:
	transferBeforeCompletion = transferAfterCompletion 
	transferAfterCompletion = transferBeforeCompletion + 6
print("Closest transfer date before completion:", transferBeforeCompletion)
print("Closest transfer date after completion:", transferAfterCompletion)
if transferBeforeCompletion <= Completion_date <= transferAfterCompletion:
        print("Congratulations! Transfer is on completion date")
